{"name":"LZW Encoder in SystemC","tagline":"An implementation of LZW encoder in SystemC and verified in FPGA","body":"\r\n\r\nThis is an implemetation of an LZW encoder in SystemC which has been verified\r\nby implementing a test bench and requisite test vectors. Only those constructs\r\nof SystemC have been used which are synthesizabe abd recognized by the \"SC2V\"\r\nconverter. It has than been converted to Verilog code by using the open source \r\n\"SC2V\" program. The converted RTL is again verified in verilog simulations, and \r\nthen verified in a Xilinx FPGA. The Digilent Spartan3 system board was used to \r\nverify the LZW code.\r\n\r\n# DOC\r\nThe doc folder contains a document which describes the LZW implementation, \r\nas well as the testbench implementation\r\n \r\n# SystemC\r\nThe systemc folder contains the LZW implementation files in SystemC format. \r\nThis is synthesizable SystemC code.\r\n\r\n# SystemC Models\r\nThe systemc_models folder contains the serial port, model used \r\nin simulation, which is implemented in systemC \r\n\r\n# SystemC Test Bench\r\nThe systemc_tb folder contains the testbench for simulation in SystemC \r\nformat.\r\n\r\n# Converted Verilog RTL\r\nThe converted_verilog_rtl folder contains the LZW rtl files, converted from \r\nsystemC using the SC2V open source converter. A C-Shell script \"sc2v.sh\" is \r\npresent to convert all SystemC synthesizable files to Verilog format.\r\n\r\n# Verilog Models\r\nThe verilog_models folder contains the serial port model used in simulation. \r\nThe following RAM models can be obtained from Xilinx ISE web pack for \r\nsimulation purposes.\r\nRAMB4_S8.v    \r\nRAMB4_S8_S8.v\r\nRAMB16_S18.v \r\nRAMB16_S18_S18.v\r\n\r\n# Verilog Test Bench\r\nThe verilog_tb folder contains the testbench for simulation in verilog \r\nformat, for testing the converted code.\r\n\r\n# Verilog Test Cases\r\nThe verilog_test_cases contains the test files used for RTL simulations\r\n\r\n# Run\r\nThe run folder contains a sample \"run.do\" file to run the verilog \r\nsimulations in Modelsim\r\n\r\n# FPGA Bit Files\r\nThe fpga_ucf_bit folder contains the UCF file for FPGA implementation, as \r\nwell as the bit and mcs file \r\n\r\n# FPGA Test Files\r\nThe fpga_test_files folder contains the files which are downloaded into the\r\nFPGA for compressing, through \"braypp\" serial port program.
